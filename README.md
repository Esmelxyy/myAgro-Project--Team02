## Project Title
### Analyze Yield Patterns and Client Behavior to Improve myAgroâ€™s Sales and Farm Yields
## Overview
This project was completed by my team members and I in our "BA780 Introduction to Data Analytics" class at Boston University.

We obtained datasets from one of the data analysts at myAgro. The dataset contains 4 CSV files: client, harvest, package, and payment, where each file has more than 2,000 rows and 20 columns. In particular, the harvest table only contains a sample of clients who participated in myAgro's harvest measure activities, so it has fewer rows compared to the rest.

We conducted a series of comprehensive EDA after selecting some key variables from these raw datasets. Then we decided to focus on 2 main research questions. The first one is to **analyze how crop yield differs across types, countries, seasons, etc** and the second one is to **perform geo-analytics to visualize village distribution and area for future market expansion**. 

At the end of our project, we mentioned that myAgro should encourage referral programs, different farming technologies, and adopt some integrated data collection system to improve future sales and enhance farming yields.


*This project can be used as a reference to show the targeted audience how to utilize some high-level python functions to generate some detailed visualizations and explain these findings with rigorous logic.*
